# Oracle
Sequel and PL/SQL code mainly
I've started using Oracle from version 4 on to 12c. At my current client we just started a migration to Oracle 19c for just a few left-over dedicated Oracle RDBMS systems.
We (my client, not ME) are trying to ban Oracle RDBMS and FMW software -mainly due to their rediculous licensing policies- and are  migrating the majority of instances to PostgreSQL and SQL Server.
